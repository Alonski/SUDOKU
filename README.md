# SUDOKU 
<h3> A multi process sudoku checking program. </h3>

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. 
The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid 
(also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

The app's purpose is to decide if a given matrix is valid sudoku solution.

<h4> Instructions: </h4>
To run with gcc compiler:
1. Open linux terminal in the relevant directory.
2. Type: gcc -o sudoku main.c (this will produce a program called sudoku)
